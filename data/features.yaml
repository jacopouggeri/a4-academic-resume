  details: |
    I am a curiosity driven and passionate student with a strong interest in theoretical physics and cosmology. I am currently studying for a Master's degree in Quantum Fields and Fundamental Forces at Imperial College London. I am looking for a PhD position in Theoretical Physics, starting in 2024. Outside of physics, my interests extend to computer science, machine learning, and graphic design. I also enjoy tavelling and learning about new languages and cultures.
