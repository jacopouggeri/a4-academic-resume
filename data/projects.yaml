    - Research experience in the Wolfram Physics project, Causal Set Theory, and General Relativity
    - First-ever analysis of curved spacetime entropy in the Wolfram Physics Project.
    - Applied Wolfram language computational tools to obtain the causal graph structure of a Schwarzschild black hole.
    - Investigated the hypothesis that black hole entropy emerges from the entanglement of the interior and exterior causal graph regions.
