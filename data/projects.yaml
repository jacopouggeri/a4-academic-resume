- title: "Black Hole Entanglement Entropy From Causal Graphs"
  subtitle:
  location: "Wolfram Summer School"
  supervisor: "Jonathan Gorard"
  date: "2023"
  details: |
    - Research experience in the Wolfram Physics project, Causal Set Theory, and General Relativity
    - First-ever analysis of curved spacetime entropy in the Wolfram Physics Project.
    - Applied Wolfram language computational tools to obtain the causal graph structure of a Schwarzschild black hole.
    - Investigated the hypothesis that black hole entropy emerges from the entanglement of the interior and exterior causal graph regions.

- title: Critical Temperature of an Ising Model on a Sierpinski Gasket 
  location: Summer Project at Imperial College London
  date: "2020"
  details: |
    - Worked remotely with a peer to simulate an Ising model on a Sierpinski gasket network
    - Wrote Python code to run, visualize and analyze the simulation, and numerically evaluated the model’s critical temperature and the corresponding critical exponent
    - Delivered a video summary of the project and a project report
