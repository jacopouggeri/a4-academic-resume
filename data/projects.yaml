- title: "Black Hole Entanglement Entropy From Causal Graphs"
  subtitle: "Wolfram Summer School"
  date: "2023"
  details: |
    - Research experience in the Wolfram Physics project, Causal Set Theory, and General Relativity
    - First-ever analysis of curved spacetime entropy in the Wolfram Physics Project.
    - Applied Wolfram language computational tools to obtain the causal graph structure of a Schwarzschild black hole.
    - Investigated the hypothesis that black hole entropy emerges from the entanglement of the interior and exterior causal graph regions.

    - Supervisor: James Owen
    - Determined the photoevaporation rate of red giants around supermassive black holes and how it affects their evolution.
    - Computational and theoretical project: designed, wrote, and tested shareable code.
    - Developed critical scientific thinking and research skills.
    - Reached positive and encouraging conclusions.
