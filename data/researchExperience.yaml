    - Investigated the impact of photoevaporation on red giants in proximity to supermassive black holes
    - Computational and theoretical project: designed, wrote, and tested shareable code
    - Produced a comprehensive analysis, concluding that photoevaporation can significantly influence a red giant's life

- title: Critical Temperature of an Ising Model on a Sierpinski Gasket 
  disable: true
  location: Summer Project at Imperial College London
  date: "2020"
  details: |
    - Worked remotely with a peer to simulate an Ising model on a Sierpinski gasket network
    - Wrote Python code to run, visualize and analyze the simulation, and numerically evaluated the model's critical temperature and the corresponding critical exponent
    - Delivered a video summary of the project and a project report
