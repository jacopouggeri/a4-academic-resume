  details: |
    - Research experience in the Wolfram Physics project, Causal Set Theory, and General Relativity
    - Completed first-ever analysis of curved spacetime entropy in the Wolfram Physics Project
    - Applied numerical GR tools in Wolfram Language to obtain causal structure of a Schwarzschild black hole
    - Investigated the hypothesis that black hole entropy emerges from the entanglement of the interior and exterior causal graph regions
